# JSON Parser

This is a library written from scratch that provides a top-down ([recursive descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser)) parser for JSON files.

It comprises the C++ API and the following four tools:
- **`checker`** checks the correctness of a JSON input.
- **`prettify`** formats a JSON input with 4-spaces indentation.
- **`stringify`** removes all syntactically useless whitespaces.
- **`gnuchecker`** acts like `checker` but it's made with Bison and Flex

When using the API, an AST [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) is built as a result of the parsing phase.
The user can navigate the AST directly jumping from one node to its children or
automatically through the [visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).

Every node of the AST build out of the parsing phase matches a production of the [CFG grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) defined in [grammar.ebnf](grammar.ebnf) 
and formatted in the [Extended Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).


## GNU Checker with Bison+Flex

For the sake of performance comparison, the `gnu` directory contains the implementation
of a JSON parser (named **`gnuchecker`** in this repo) with [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) and [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex).
The executable can be used as a fast checker since it parses the grammar productions
without performing any action.

Bison and Flex can be installed with `apt install bison` and `apt install flex` respectively.

## Compile

For the C++ parser (`checker`) and the examples:
```
make                # with g++
make CC=clang++     # or with clang++, if available
```
`gnuchecker` can be compiled with:
```
make gnuchecker
```

## API Examples

In the root directory there are some examples of how this library can be used.
As a general guideline, by implementing a new _visitor_ it is possibile to explore
the entire AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated.

```c++
json_parser::AST ast1("[1,3.2,\"tag\"]");
ast1.Build();
std::cout << ast1.children[0]->children[0]->ToString() << "\n"; // 1
std::cout << ast1.children[0]->children[1]->ToString() << "\n"; // 3.2
std::cout << ast1.children[0]->children[2]->ToString() << "\n"; // "tag"
```
```c++
json_parser::AST ast2("{\"key\":-9.8e+23}");
ast2.Build();
std::cout << ast2.children[0]->children[0]->children[0]->ToString() << "\n"; // "key"
std::cout << ast2.children[0]->children[0]->children[1]->ToString() << "\n"; // -9.8e+23

```

Using the `PrettifyVisitor` visitor already implemented in [`prettify.cpp`](prettify.cpp)):

```c++
// ast_node = instance of a derived class of json_parser::ASTNode
//            e.g. json_parser::Array
PrettifyVisitor fv;
ast_node.Accept(fv);
std::cout << fv.GetResult();
```

## Benchmarking

To run a parsing benchmark on the set of JSON files provided in `data/benchmark` use `make benchmark`.
The command uses `checker` as the default program during the benchmark,
to set another one set the `CMD` make variable appropriately.

Here are some examples:
```
make benchmark CMD=checker
make benchmark CMD=prettify
make benchmark CMD=gnuchecker CC=g++
make benchmark CMD=gnuchecker CC=clang++
```

The command will produce an output like the following (time in seconds):
```
file                              size[MB]  time[s]  speed[MB/s]
data/benchmark/canada.json        2.146     .260     8.253
data/benchmark/citm_catalog.json  1.647     .102     16.147
data/benchmark/twitter.json       .602      .054     11.148
```

To obtain benchmark results in CSV format directly use `./benchmark`.
For example:
```
./benchmark.sh prettify
```

## Testing

To run a conformance test:
```
make test CMD=checker
```
or just `make test`.
This will produce an output like 
```
Total: 39 Passed: 38 Failed: 1
```

For a more verbose output with the details of each single test use `./test.sh`.

## Running example: Prettify

The command-line tool [`prettify.cpp`](prettify.cpp) implements a visitor that produces a formatted version of any JSON file.

Example of `prettify` in action on the `data/short.json`:
```json
{"a":{"b":1.2,"c":3,"d":[4,5]},"e":[]}
```
```
$ ./prettify data/short.json
{
    "a": {
        "b": 1.2,
        "c": 3,
        "d": [
            4,
            5
        ]
    },
    "e": []
}
```

## Bugs

Here is a list of known bugs regarding both the C++ checker and the Bison/Flex program.
- `data/fail/fail18.json` gets incorrectly accepted as there are no checks regarding the depth
of nested arrays.
