JSON files in the `fail` and `pass` directories are taken from the [json.org](http://json.org/JSON_checker/).
- Files in the `fail` directory are supposed to be rejected by the checker.
- Files in the `pass` directory are supposed to be accepted by the checker.

On the other hand,
- `canada.json`
- `citm_catalog.json` and 
- `twitter.json`

in the `data/benchmark` directory can be used for benchmarks, see [Native JSON Benchmark](https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark).
